# disparity-matching
**In this project, we calculate the disparity map of two rectified images which imitate two eyes. In this project, SAD and DP algorithms (simplified) are implemented. PyCUDA codes are typically included.**
> "cudadpAdvanced.py" is the pycuda code for Dynamic Programming.
> "sad.py" is the pycuda code for local algorithms (SAD&SSD).
> "stereo-matching.py" is local algorithms which could be implemented on CPU.
> "dpmatching.py" is dp algorithm which could be implemented on CPU.
> "imL.png" and "imR.png" are input left images and right images
