# disparity-matching
In this project, we calculate the disparity map of two rectified images which imitate two eyes. In this project, SAD and DP algorithms (simplified) are implemented. PyCUDA codes are typically included.
1. "cudadpAdvanced.py" is the pycuda code for Dynamic Programming.\\
2. "sad.py" is the pycuda code for local algorithms (SAD&SSD).\\
3. "stereo-matching.py" is local algorithms which could be implemented on CPU.\\
4. "dpmatching.py" is dp algorithm which could be implemented on CPU.\\
5. "imL.png" and "imR.png" are input left images and right images
