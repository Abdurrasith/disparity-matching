# disparity-matching
`This is a code by Qingwei Wu and Reixuan Zhang`   

**In this project, we calculate the disparity map of two rectified images which imitate two eyes. In this project, SAD and DP algorithms (simplified) are implemented. PyCUDA codes are typically included.**
1. "cudadpAdvanced.py" is the pycuda code for Dynamic Programming.  
2. "sad.py" is the pycuda code for local algorithms (SAD&SSD).  
3. "stereo-matching.py" is local algorithms which could be implemented on CPU.  
4. "dpmatching.py" is dp algorithm which could be implemented on CPU.  
5. "imL.png" and "imR.png" are input left images and right images.
